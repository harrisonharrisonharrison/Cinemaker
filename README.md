## How We Built It

**Frontend:**  
- Built with **React** (functional components, hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`)  
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive UI

**Backend:**  
- **Flask** server with endpoints:  
  - `/api/skip` for skipping to the next trailer  
  - `/api/describe` for AI-generated summaries  
- Integrated with **Google GenAI's Gemini API**

**Data Flow:**  
1. User skips or selects a trailer  
2. React sends a request to Flask  
3. Flask queries Gemini for a summary  
4. React receives and updates UI in real-time

**Deployment Tools:**  
- `Flask-CORS` for smooth client-server communication  
- `dotenv` for secure key management  
- Local dev on `localhost:3000` (React) + `localhost:5000` (Flask)
